Title: Balancing Central and Marginal Rejection of Pooled p-Values
Description: When using pooled p-values to adjust for multiple testing, there is an inherent balance that must be struck between rejection based on weak evidence spread among many tests and strong evidence in a few, explored in Salahub and Olford (2023) <arXiv:2310.16600>. This package provides functionality to compute marginal and central rejection levels and the centrality quotient for p-value pooling functions and provides implementations of the chi-squared quantile pooled p-value (described in Salahub and Oldford (2023)) and a proposal from Heard and Rubin-Delanchy (2018) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asx076> to control the quotient's value.
